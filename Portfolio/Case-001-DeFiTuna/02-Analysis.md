The attackers created a nearly empty TUNA/USDC Fusion pool.
They set its initial price close to the legitimate oracle price, so DeFiTuna’s pre-swap price-deviation checks passed.
Then placed two attacker-controlled limit-order positions in that pool at abnormally high tick 208,640, adding 0.000526 + 0.000526 = 0.001052 TUNA.
Call DefiTuna: Open_and_increase_tuna_spot_position_jupiter
Decoding the Instruction Data referencing tuna.json get That the attacker opened the opened a DeFiTuna spot position with zero collateral The 570K USDC borrowed from lending pool minus fee were routed through Embedded Jupiter Router, and the 47 bytes instruction specified the swap path.
The path is to swap 569,601 USDC, which is all USDC borrowed minus the fees, for TUNA through the prepared thin pool
The exact swap is at tick 208640 as they are the only non-empty ones, considering 0.1% fee, the output amount is 569601/(1.0001)^208640*(1-0.001) = 0.000494845, rounded down to 0.000494 TUNA.
After receiving those 494 raw units, DeFiTuna valued the position at its pre-swap/oracle price 0.001837534 in is_healthy() -> compute_total_and_debt() (tuna_position.rs).
At line51, 494 × 0.0018375338 = 0.9077417.

At line 53, to_num:() converts the positive fixed-point value to an integer by discarding the fractional part, so the result is zero.
Then the zero ‘total’ was evaluated under the assumption that “the leverage of an empty position is always 1.0x.” and the position is considered healthy.

The USDC now belonged economically to the two malicious limit-order positions. So each attacker called DecreaseLimitOrder to withdraw 284,280.483231 USDC each.

Vulnerability
In TunaPosition.ishealthy() solvency check, the zero ‘total’ value was evaluated under the assumption that “the leverage of an empty position is always 1.0x.” and the position is considered healthy.
The self.compute_total_and_debt() uses a reference sqrt_price and round down the result in its calculation at line 53.
The attacker engineered a very skewed pool that after routing USDC assets to the pool through an arbitrary swap path, the returning asset value is so small that the rounding in to_num::() reduced the total to zero, effectively bypassing the solvency check.
